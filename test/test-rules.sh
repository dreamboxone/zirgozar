# The firewall ruleset, put in front of a real nft rather than read carefully.

#   sh test/test-rules.sh
#
# nftables parses a ruleset and then fails at commit time when a kernel module
# is missing, and `nft --check` catches neither that nor a typo in a chain that
# only appears when a particular setting is switched on. So every combination
# of the settings that change the ruleset is generated and checked, which is
# how the QUIC option came to load fine on its own and break the whole ruleset
# the moment it was combined with anything else.
