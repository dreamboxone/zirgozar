# What the parser and the configuration generator do, checked against a real

#   RIG_XRAY=/path/to/xray sh test/test-config.sh [list-file]
#
# Without RIG_XRAY the JSON is still checked for shape; with it, every single
# outbound the parser emits is put in front of the binary that will have to
# run it. That is the check that matters: "valid JSON" and "a configuration
# Xray will accept" are not the same thing, and the difference is a router
# that installs cleanly and never connects.
