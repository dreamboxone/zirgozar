# The whole of choosing a server, run for real.
#
#   RIG_XRAY=/path/to/xray sh test/test-probe.sh
#
# The candidates here are not real servers. Most of them are `freedom`
# outbounds - the core's own direct connection - and one is a blackhole. So
# every part of the machinery runs exactly as it does in anger (a batch
# configuration, a core holding ten SOCKS ports, ten timed requests through
# them, the early exit, the writing down of the winner) without any of it
# depending on whether some stranger's free server happens to be up this
# morning. A test that fails because a free server died is a test nobody
# believes, and a test nobody believes is worse than no test.
#
# The blackhole is there to prove the other half: a candidate that answers
# nothing must be passed over rather than chosen or crashed on.
