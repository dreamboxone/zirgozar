# ca-bundle is not decoration. Every address this program fetches from is
# HTTPS, and on a router without certificates curl refuses all of them with an
# error most people read as "the site is blocked".
#
# ip-full likewise: busybox provides a cut-down `ip` under the same name that
# cannot add the local route transparent proxying needs, and the failure looks
# like a tunnel that loads every rule perfectly and carries nothing.
#
# kmod-nft-socket is optional to the ruleset but wanted: without it every
# packet of every connection goes through the transparent-proxy lookup again
# instead of being handed straight to the socket that already owns it.
#
# Deliberately absent: xray-core. A router that has one already - because
# PassWall2 pulled it in - needs nothing, and this finds it. Depending on it
# would drag a second copy onto routers that do not need one, and refusing to
# install alongside it would be worse still.

ZGZ_DESC="Transparent proxy client for OpenWrt built on Xray, for Iran. Reads its server list every quarter of an hour, sifts a hundred servers with one handshake each and then measures only the ones that answered, ten at a time, until it finds one fast enough. Optional Iran routing split, per-day traffic accounting, and both nftables and iptables."
LUCI_DESC="Web interface for Zirgozar: connect, servers and subscriptions, traffic, and settings."

# Every quarter of an hour for the list, every five minutes for the counters.
#
# They are separate because they cost different things. Reading the list is
# one small request that only reaches flash on the days it changed. Reading
# the counters is a local call, and doing it often is what makes the traffic
# figures useful - but it is added up in RAM and only written to storage once
# an hour, so five-minute resolution costs no extra flash wear at all.
