# ------------------------------------------------------------------ timing

# Run a command with a ceiling on how long it may take.
#
# Not `timeout`, because `timeout` is not on every router. It is a busybox
# applet and a stock OpenWrt 25.12 image does not build it in: `timeout 5 true`
# there exits 127, "not found". Every call in this program was written
# `timeout N cmd || true` or tested with `if timeout N cmd`, so on such a
# router not one of them ran and not one of them said so.
#
# What that cost was the entire program. rpcd was never told the web interface
# existed, so every button on every page did nothing at all. The crontab was
# never reloaded. Pressing Connect ran a restart that never happened and was
# then reported as a failed start. dnsmasq was never restarted, so name
# lookups never moved into the tunnel. Installing the missing dependencies
# never installed anything. All of it silent, on a freshly flashed router,
# with every script behind it working perfectly by hand.
#
# So: use it where it works, and do the same job with a background watchdog
# where it does not.
#
# Where it works - not where it exists. A router can have /usr/bin/timeout as
# a link to a busybox built without the applet: the link is there, `command -v`
# finds it, and every call through it answers "applet not found" with 127.
# That was the same silent failure all over again on a freshly flashed 25.12
# router: the tunnel was never started, never enabled at boot, and dnsmasq
# was never restarted. So it is asked to run something first - once per
# process, the first time a ceiling is needed.

#
# The choice is made by asking, not by comparing version numbers: with a
# configuration to hand, each candidate is offered it and the first that
# accepts wins. An older core that cannot read a modern REALITY or xhttp
# stanza is exactly what a version check would wave through, and it would
# then fail at the only moment that matters.

	# was built to look - and ours are in /etc/zirgozar/geo, so a configuration
	# naming geosite:ir was handed to a core that then looked somewhere else,
	# found either nothing or a different project's file with no ir category
	# in it, and refused the lot. Every core refused it for the same reason,
	# find_xray ran out of candidates, and the service gave up with "no xray on
	# this router can run the generated configuration" - on a router where the
	# files were present, correct, and thirty megabytes of them.
	#
	# It only bit with the Iran split switched on, because that is the only
